				<h1>Hi There! üëã</h1>
				<hr />
				<p>
					I am an IT Systems Engineer with over 15 years experience in the industry. 
					
					I spent a large portion of my career in consulting and managed services roles, 
					giving me a broad exposure to many different technologies and verticals. From infrastructure design, software development, and GIS to healthcare, I've had the opportunity to work with a wide variety of clients and technologies.
				</p>
	
				<p>
					At this point in my career, I currently have a heavy focus on automation, devops, site reliability, and cloud technologies. 
					I have a strong passion for learning and sharing knowledge with others, which is why I started this blog.
